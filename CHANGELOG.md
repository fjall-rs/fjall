- [feat] Rewritten key-value separation to run during compactions, instead of dedicated GC runs
- [feat] Full file checksums to allow fast database corruption checks (in the future)
- [feat] Checksum check on block & blob reads
- [api] Change constructor to `Database::builder` instead of `Config::new`
- [api] Changed naming of keyspace->database, and partition->keyspace
