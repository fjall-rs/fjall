*Fjall* is a log-structured, embeddable key-value storage engine written in Rust.
It features:

- Thread-safe BTreeMap-like API
- 100% safe & stable Rust
- LSM-tree-based storage similar to `RocksDB`
- Range & prefix searching with forward and reverse iteration
- Multiple keyspaces (a.k.a. column families) with cross-keyspace atomic semantics
- Built-in compression (default = LZ4)
- Serializable transactions (optional)
- Key-value separation for large blob use cases (optional)
- Automatic background maintenance

It is not:

- a standalone server
- a relational or wide-column database: it has no built-in notion of columns

Keys are limited to 65536 bytes, values are limited to 2^32 bytes.
As is normal with any kind of storage engine, larger keys and values have a bigger performance impact.

Like any typical key-value store, keys are stored in lexicographic order.
If you are storing integer keys (e.g. timeseries data), you should use the big endian form to adhere to locality.

## Basic usage

```bash
cargo add fjall
```

```rust
use fjall::{Config, PersistMode, Database, KeyspaceCreateOptions};

// A database may contain multiple collections ("keyspace")
// You should probably only use a single database for your application
let db = Database::builder(folder).open_or_create()?; // or open_transactional for transactional semantics

// Each keyspace is its own physical LSM-tree, and thus isolated from other keyspaces
let items = db.create_or_open_keyspace("my_items", KeyspaceCreateOptions::default())?;

// Write some data
items.insert("a", "hello")?;

// And retrieve it
let bytes = items.get("a")?;

// Or remove it again
items.remove("a")?;

// Search by prefix
for kv in items.prefix("prefix") {
  // ...
}

// Search by range
for kv in items.range("a"..="z") {
  // ...
}

// Iterators implement DoubleEndedIterator, so you can search backwards, too!
for kv in items.prefix("prefix").rev() {
  // ...
}

// Sync the journal to disk to make sure data is definitely durable
// When the database is dropped, it will try to persist with `PersistMode::SyncAll` automatically
keyspace.persist(PersistMode::SyncAll)?;
```

## Durability

To support different kinds of workloads, Fjall is agnostic about the type of durability
your application needs.
After writing data (`insert`, `remove` or committing a write batch/transaction), you can choose to call [`Database::persist`](https://docs.rs/fjall/latest/fjall/struct.Database.html#method.persist) which takes a [`PersistMode`](https://docs.rs/fjall/latest/fjall/enum.PersistMode.html) parameter.
By default, any operation will flush to OS buffers, but **not** to disk.
This is in line with RocksDB's default durability.
Also, when dropped, the database will try to persist the journal *to disk* synchronously.

## Multithreading, Async and Multiprocess

> [!WARNING]
> A single database may **not** be loaded in parallel from separate *processes*.

Fjall is internally synchronized for multi-*threaded* access, so you can clone around the `Database` and `Keyspace`s as needed, without needing to lock yourself.

For an async example, see the [`tokio`](https://github.com/fjall-rs/fjall/tree/main/examples/tokio) example.

## Feature flags

### lz4

Allows using `LZ4` compression, powered by [`lz4_flex`](https://github.com/PSeitz/lz4_flex).

*Enabled by default.*

### single_writer_tx

Allows opening a transactional Keyspace for single-writer (serialized) transactions, allowing RYOW (read-your-own-write), fetch-and-update and other atomic operations.

*Enabled by default.*

### ssi_tx

Allows opening a transactional Keyspace for multi-writer, serializable transactions, allowing RYOW (read-your-own-write), fetch-and-update and other atomic operations.
Conflict checking is done using optimistic concurrency control.

*Disabled by default.
Mutually exclusive with `single_writer_tx`.*

### bytes

Uses [`bytes`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/bytes) as the underlying `Slice` type.

*Disabled by default.*

## Stable disk format

The disk format is stable as of 1.0.0.

2.0.0 uses a new disk format and needs a manual format migration.

Future breaking changes will result in a major version bump and a migration path.

For the underlying LSM-tree implementation, see: <https://crates.io/crates/lsm-tree>.
